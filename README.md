# TruCoder Data

TruCoder keeps you informed about various upcoming competitive coding contests. It also helps you track your performance in competitions hosted on platforms like CodeChef and Codeforces.

## Contest Scheduler

The `contest_scheduler.py` script is responsible for fetching the data of upcoming contests. This script is run periodically using GitHub Actions.

The fetched data is stored in a JSON file located in the `data` folder.
